# ALX Project 0x13 - JavaScript Objects, Scopes, Closures

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and applying key concepts in JavaScript, including Objects, Scopes, and Closures. It provides a series of tasks aimed at reinforcing your knowledge of these fundamental aspects of JavaScript programming.

## Project Structure

- Each task is located in its respective directory, named `task_0`, `task_1`, and so on.
- Inside each task directory, you will find a JavaScript file (e.g., `0-object_initializer.js`) containing the solution for that task.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have a working environment for running JavaScript code (e.g., a web browser console or Node.js).

### Task Execution

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uluchukwu/alx-0x13-javascript-objects-scopes-closures.git
